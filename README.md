# SecureCheck

**Threat Model:** SecureCheck Password Checker App

**Threat Actor:** Insider with Malicious Intent
## Objectives:

**Nefarious Application Creation:** Develop a malicious password checking application under the guise of SecureCheck to facilitate unauthorized activities.

**Credential Harvesting:** Exploit the application to collect user credentials surreptitiously.

**Vulnerability Exploitation:** Identify and exploit weaknesses in the organization's security infrastructure.

**Unauthorized Access:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.

## Attack Surface:
### 1. Nefarious Password Checker Application:
**Backdoor Implementation:** Insert a hidden backdoor in the application for persistent unauthorized access. **Not in this model**

**Data Interception:** Intercept and capture user credentials during the validation process.

**False Sense of Security:** Mimic legitimate password checking features to deceive users under the guise of SecureCheck.

### 2. Organization's Network:
**Internal Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the organization's network and infrastructure.

**Lateral Movement:** Move laterally within the network to escalate privileges.

### 3. External Services (e.g., Discord Webhook):

**Unauthorized Data Transmission:** Exploit the communication channel between the application and external services for unauthorized data transmission.

**Data Eavesdropping:** Monitor and collect sensitive information transmitted over external channels.

## Exploitation Techniques:
### 1. Nefarious Application Exploitation:
**Misleading UI:** Design the application with a deceptive user interface to encourage users to input credentials.

**Silent Credential Exfiltration:** Capture and send collected credentials without alerting users or security systems.

**Dynamic Backdoor Activation:** Activate the backdoor dynamically to avoid detection. **Not in this model**

### 2. Network Exploitation:
**Covert Communication:** Use covert communication techniques to avoid detection while transmitting data externally.

**Traffic Obfuscation:** Mask malicious network traffic to resemble legitimate traffic.

**Exploit Unsecured Channels:** Identify and exploit unsecured communication channels within the network.

### 3. Social Engineering:
**Trust Elicitation:** Establish trust with users through deceptive means to encourage credential input.

**False Security Assurance:** Convince users that the application is legitimate and secure under the guise of SecureCheck to lower suspicion.

## Mitigation Strategies:
### 1. Application Security:
**Code Audits and Anomaly Detection:** Regularly audit code for suspicious activities and implement anomaly detection mechanisms.

**Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor application behavior to detect unusual patterns indicative of malicious activity.

**User Authentication Controls:** Implement strict controls on user authentication processes.

### 2. Network Security:
**Network Anomaly Detection:** Deploy advanced network anomaly detection systems to identify unusual traffic patterns.

**Traffic Analysis:** Regularly analyze network traffic for signs of unauthorized data transmission.

**Segmented Network Access:** Restrict and monitor access within segmented network areas.
